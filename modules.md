# Modules

Modules offer dynamic content and features that can enrich your forum's layout, providing users with an interactive platform. To get started with modules, you first need to review the available options and then customize their settings according to your preferences.

## Using Modules

Take a look at the list of available modules located on the right-hand panel. From there, you can drag and drop modules into a panel on the left marked "Section" to add them to your layout. It's important to note that the SMF section is always empty. If you want to remove a module from the layout, simply drag it away.

**Customize Module Settings**: Access the settings page for each module to tailor its behavior and appearance according to your preferences. Experiment with different configurations to create a personalized experience for your forum users.

**Flexibility with Module Templates**: Dream Portal introduces the concept of Module Templates, which offer different container designs for modules. Unlike other portals with predefined container styles, Dream Portal allows third-party developers to create Module Template Packages that can be installed, uninstalled, or deleted.
