# Using Modules

Modules offer dynamic content and features that can enrich your forum's layout, providing users with an interactive platform. To get started with modules, you first need to review the available options and then customize their settings according to your preferences.

## Review Available Modules

Take a look at the list of available modules located on the right-hand panel. From there, you can drag and drop modules into a panel on the left marked "Sections" to add them to your layout. It's important to note that the SMF section is always empty. If you want to remove a module from the layout, simply drag it away.

## Customize Module Settings

Each module comes with its own settings page where you can customize various aspects such as title, icon, visibility of the title, and permissions. Some modules may even add additional fields for further customization. Refer to the relevant sections for more details.
